Any shop/purchase plugin supporting vault is supported here!  \r\n5) Tax system allows for a \"Sales Tax\" on each money transfer. The settings for whether the buyer or the seller is held responsible for tax, and for tax rates, are available in the config.  \r\n\r\nCommands:  \r\n\r\n/money - List current amount of Dogecoins in your minecraft account.  \r\n/transact <player> <amount> - Transfer's money from your account to the selected player's account.  \r\n/deposit - Get a Bitcoin address to send a deposit to.
